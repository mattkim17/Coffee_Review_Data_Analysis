# Coffee_Review_Data_Analysis

As a casual but passionate coffee drinker, I wanted to analyze coffee reviews posted online to see if I can get a better understanding of important characteristics of different types of coffee beans. Not only that, I wanted to see if certain coffee types received higher ratings than other types. For the data, I web scrapped through coffeereviews.com reviews that began as early as 1997.

For this data analysis I will do the following:

  - Exploratory Data Analysis
  - Attempt at making a coffee classifier through Machine Learning
  - Create wordclouds to get qualitative insight into the description words to describe a certain type of coffee bean
